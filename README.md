# NeXt Warning System

## Vision

> We will deliver a warning service that will save lives and protect livelihoods; by providing accurate and relevant information to users who need it, when they need it, in ways they want it â€“ so they can take the right action.

## Delivery strategy

* XWS will be designed to be hazard agnostic
* XWS will be designed to be organisation agnostic
* XWS will be designed so that it can be deployed independently by other parties
* XWS will be designed to allow for real-time deployment without downtime
* XWS will be designed to allow for configuration via a Admin UI for some key elements
* XWS will be designed to scale automatically to adapt to increased usage
* Any code created will be shared openly on GitHub
* XWS will use and contribute to open standards, common components and patterns
* Code will be documented to provide clear guidance on how to use it

### Other development areas

There are also other development areas that need to be explored in Alpha. These additional areas will be vital for moving to Beta effectively. These development areas could be completed by contractors or by External Digital Services.
