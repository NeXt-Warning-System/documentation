# NeXt Warning System

## Vision

> We will deliver a warning service that will save lives and protect livelihoods; by providing accurate and relevant information to users who need it, when they need it, in ways they want it â€“ so they can take the right action.

## Delivery strategy

* XWS will be designed to be hazard agnostic
* XWS will be designed to be organisation agnostic
* XWS will be designed so that it can be deployed independently by other parties
* XWS will be designed to allow for real-time deployment without downtime
* XWS will be designed to allow for configuration via a Admin UI for some key elements
* XWS will be designed to scale automatically to adapt to increased usage
* Any code created will be shared openly on GitHub
* XWS will use and contribute to open standards, common components and patterns
* Code will be documented to provide clear guidance on how to use it
