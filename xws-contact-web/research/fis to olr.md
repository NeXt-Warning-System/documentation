# xws-contact-web: Linking the Flood Information Service to the Get flood warnings pages

## Hypothesis

By linking the Flood Information Serivce Target Area pages to the "Get flood warnings" pages, we can enable users to register for areas they are interested in seamlessly. Users on a TA specific FIS page could select "get flood warnings" and be passed to the "Get flood warnings" pages with the specific TA code stored and used for the registation location.
