# xws-contact-web: linking the "Flood Information Service" (FIS) and "Check your long term flood risk" (LTFRI) to the "Get flood warnings" pages

## Hypothesis

By linking FIS and LTFRI to the "Get flood warnings" pages, we can enable users to register for areas they are interested in seamlessly. 

## Method

Users on a TA specific FIS page could select "get flood warnings for this area" and be passed to the "Get flood warnings" pages with the specific TA code stored and used for the registation location.
