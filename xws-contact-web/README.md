* Remove the need for a user account number and password
* Stop incorrect contact details from being entered into the system be using a contact verification process
* Remove duplicate accounts carried over from the incumbent system

### MVP

* Single channel (text) initially
* UK telephone numbers only
* Landline and mobile only
* English UI only
* English language choice only
* Use the minimum required data to provide a warning service to our users

## Policy implications

* Lower proportion of registered properties - more "area" based registrations
* Potentially more EDW users?
