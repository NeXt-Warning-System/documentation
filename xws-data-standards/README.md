# xws-data-standards

We rely on good quality data to do our jobs and achieve our objectives. 
Data Standards improve our data and make it easier to use by ensuring we capture data consistently. In order to share and understand data, we must standardise the format as well as the content.

This means calling the same thing the same name, and recording the same data in the same way, for example the specification of how we must all use address data.

Data standards are an essential tool in good data management. By defining, publishing and using data standards, we can improve consistency in our data, so that it is:

* is easier to join it up
* is easier to analyse
* is easier to re-use
* is more reliable for reporting
* can reduce the cost of changing the format at a later date

## Objectives

* Agree data standards for use in XWS
* Use open standards wherever possible
